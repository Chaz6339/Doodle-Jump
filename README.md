## Project Information
Our project is a remake of the popular mobile game Doodle Jump. In the Doodle Jump game
world, the user controls a doodle character as it jumps from platform to platform and navigates
obstacles such as monsters and black holes. The goal of the game is to travel as far upwards as possible 
without falling off the screen or colliding with obstacles. As the doodle rises higher and higher, the game difficulty
increases by spawning more obstacles and generating platforms farther and farther apart.

Game images are provided from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ra4king/JDoodle-Jump/tree/master/src/res/images/normal

## Package Structure
Within the final project, our main/java folder contains the org.ACTW directory
containing all classes pertaining to game design and functionality. THere are two subdirectories
in ACTW called "charactersandmobs" containing the obstacles characters and "screens" containing the 
GameScreen, StatScreen, and StartScreen. The resources folder contains all of our images, and the test folder 
contains test files for some of the key functions of our program.

## How to run it
The entry point of our project can be accessed by running the MainApp. This will initailize the game window and call the
start screen. From here, the user can begin gameplay by pressing the play button.
